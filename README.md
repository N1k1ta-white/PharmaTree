## Description
The system for managing medicaments was made by me as a course project for the discipline "Modern Java Technologies" at FMI. The main point of the system is to make it easier for doctors to create prescriptions by allowing them to include a set of medicaments in one prescription. The tools used for development are Java, GSON, JUnit, and Mockito.
